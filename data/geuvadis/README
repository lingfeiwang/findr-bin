The data files are downsampled from the Geuvadis study (Lappalainen, T. et al. Transcriptome and genome sequencing uncovers functional variation in humans. Nature 501, 506â€“511 (2013)), including expression levels of 10 miRNAs and 3000 genes for 360 European individuals. Among them, all miRNAs and 1000 genes have significant cis-eQTLs, whose haplotypes are also included. File data formats follow Findr's binary interface input/output requirement. A description of each file is available below:

dmi.dat:	Expression levels of 10 miRNAs
dgmi.dat:	Haplotypes of cis-eQTLs of 10 miRNAs
dc.dat:		Continuous causal anchors for demonstration purposes, simulated from adding continuous noise to dgmi.dat
dt.dat:		Expression levels of 1000 genes that have cis-eQTLs
dt2.dat:	Expression levels of 3000 genes
dgt.dat:	Haplotypes of cis-eQTLs of 1000 genes
namest.txt:	3000 gene names
*.tsv: The same data of *.dat in tsv format
